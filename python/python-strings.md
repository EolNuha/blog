# Python Strings: A Beginner's Guide to Manipulating Textual Data

One of the most common tasks in any programming language is working with strings. In this blog post, we will explore the basics of Python strings, including how to create and manipulate them.

## Creating Strings

In Python, a string is a sequence of characters enclosed in single quotes (' ') or double quotes (" "). Here are some examples:

```python
# Single quotes
string1 = 'Hello, World!'

# Double quotes
string2 = "This is a string."
```

In addition to single and double quotes, you can also use triple quotes (''' ''') or (""" """) to create multiline strings.

```python
# Multiline string
string3 = '''
This is a
multiline
string.
'''
```

## Accessing Characters in a String

Once you have created a string, you can access individual characters using indexing. In Python, indexing starts at 0. Here is an example:

```python
# Accessing characters in a string
string = "Python Strings"
print(string[0]) # Output: P
print(string[1]) # Output: y
print(string[2]) # Output: t
```

You can also use negative indexing to access characters from the end of the string. Here is an example:

```python
# Negative indexing
string = "Python Strings"
print(string[-1]) # Output: s
print(string[-2]) # Output: g
print(string[-3]) # Output: n
```

## String Slicing

In addition to accessing individual characters, you can also slice a string to access a range of characters. Here is an example:

```python
# String slicing
string = "Python Strings"
print(string[0:6]) # Output: Python
```

In this example, the slice [0:6] means to start at index 0 and go up to, but not including, index 6. You can also use negative indices in slicing. Here is an example:

```python
# Negative string slicing
string = "Python Strings"
print(string[-6:]) # Output: Strings
```

In this example, the slice [-6:] means to start at the sixth character from the end of the string and go to the end of the string.

## String Concatenation

You can concatenate (combine) two or more strings using the + operator. Here is an example:

```python
# String concatenation
string1 = "Hello"
string2 = "World"
string3 = string1 + " " + string2
print(string3) # Output: Hello World
```

## Format Strings
As we learned before in the [Python Variables](python-variables) tutorial, we cannot combine strings with other types (i.e. numbers):
:::warning Error
```python
year = 2023
txt = "Hello World, it is " + year
print(txt)
```
:::
To combine string with numbers we can use the `format()` method. The `format()` method takes the passed arguments, formats them, and places them in the string where the `{}` placeholders are:

```python
year = 2023
txt = "Hello World, it is {}"
print(txt.format(year)) #outputs: Hello World, it is 2023
```
When dealing with multiple arguments, the `format()` method places them in their respective placeholders:
```python
day = 8
month = 3
year = 2023
txt = "Hello it is day {}, month {} and year {}"
print(txt.format(day, month, year)) #outputs: Hello it is day 8, month 3 and year 2023
```
You can also make sure the arguments are placed in the right placeholders by using indexing `{0}`:
```python
day = 8
month = 3
year = 2023
txt = "Hello it is day {1}, month {2} and year {0}"
print(txt.format(year, day, month)) #outputs: Hello it is day 8, month 3 and year 2023
```

## String Methods

Python has many built-in string methods that you can use to manipulate strings. Here are a few examples:

```python
# String methods
string = "Python Strings"
print(string.upper()) # Output: PYTHON STRINGS
print(string.lower()) # Output: python strings
print(string.replace("Python", "Java")) # Output: Java Strings
```

In this example, the `upper()` method converts all characters in the string to uppercase, the `lower()` method converts all characters to lowercase, and the `replace()` method replaces all occurrences of "Python" with "Java".

## Escape Character
There are illegal characters in a string, for example using double quotes inside a string that is surrounded by double quotes.
To escape characters that are illegal in a string, you can use an escape character which is a backslash `\` followed by the character you want to insert.
:::warning Error
You will get an error if you use double quotes inside a string that is surrounded by double quotes:
```python
txt = "Hello World this is "The Innohive" blog"
```
:::
Instead what you should, do is use the escape character to insert the double strings:
```python
txt = "Hello World this is \"The Innohive\" blog"
```

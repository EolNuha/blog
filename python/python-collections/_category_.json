Lists are a collection which are ordered and changeable and allow duplicate members. Tuples are a collection which are ordered, unchangeable, and allow duplicate members. Sets are a collection which are unordered, unchangeable, unindexed, and no duplicate members. Dictionaries are a collection which are ordered, changeable, and no duplicate members."

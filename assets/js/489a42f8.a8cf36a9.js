One of the most important is the value of extracurricular activities, AP classes, and community service hours. First and foremost, it's important to START EARLY. I cannot stress this enough!!! Starting early will give you heads-up for the complex procedure you\u2019re going to put yourself through with every step of the application. Students should begin thinking about these things as soon as possible so they have plenty of time to develop their skills and make an impact in their community. If you start early, your future self is going to thank you! However, it's also important to choose wisely. Students should participate in activities they are genuinely interested in, rather than just trying to impress colleges or build up their resumes. Consistency is key when it comes to extracurricular activities. Students should commit to their activities for the long term, rather than dropping out after a semester or two. Additionally, seeking leadership roles within these activities can be a great way to develop valuable skills and demonstrate dedication and commitment. AP classes are another important consideration. These classes can prepare students for college-level coursework and demonstrate to colleges that they are capable of handling challenging academic material. However, it's important not to overload oneself with too many activities or classes, as this can lead to burnout and stress. Finally, it's important to be true to oneself. Students should participate in activities and take classes that align with their passions and interests, rather than just trying to impress others. By being authentic and genuine, students can be happier and more compelling candidates for college or future employment opportunities. Colleges care about extracurricular activities, AP classes, and community service because they provide insights into a student's character, interests, and potential for success in college. Extracurricular activities demonstrate that students are well-rounded and have developed skills outside of the classroom. These activities can show colleges that students are passionate, dedicated, and have leadership skills. It can also show that they can manage their time effectively by balancing academics and other responsibilities. AP classes demonstrate that students are willing to challenge themselves academically and are capable of handling college-level coursework. AP classes are often more rigorous than regular high school courses, and achieving high scores on AP exams can indicate that students are prepared for the academic demands of college. Community service shows that students are committed to giving back to their community, have a sense of social responsibility, and are willing to contribute to society.

Filling out the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) or the College Scholarship Service (CSS) Profile is the first step in the financial aid process. But, it's not just about filling out the forms, it's about doing it on time. The FAFSA and CSS Profile are the two most common forms used to determine your eligibility for financial aid. The FAFSA is used to determine your eligibility for federal financial aid, while the CSS Profile is used by many colleges and universities to determine eligibility for institutional aid. Each college has its own deadline for submitting financial aid forms, so it's essential to check the deadline for each college you plan to apply. It's best to start early and make sure you have plenty of time to complete the application process. Remember that some colleges have early application deadlines for financial aid, so it's crucial to know when these deadlines are. Creating a list of all the colleges you plan to apply to and researching their financial aid requirements is an excellent way to stay organized. Take the time to research each college's financial aid website to get a clear understanding of what they require. Some colleges may require additional forms or documentation, such as tax returns or bank statements. Be sure to gather all the required documents before the deadline. If you're applying for financial aid through the CSS Profile, you may also need to submit the Institutional Documentation Service (IDOC) form. The IDOC form is used to collect additional financial information that colleges may require.

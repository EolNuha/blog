When I (an international student) decided to apply to colleges in the U.S., I had absolutely no clue where to start. I often felt alone, anxious, helpless, and confused. If this is you, you’re reading the right blog!</p><p>So, welcome to my college application and prep blog! There are many things to consider and prepare before you can submit your application. I will provide tips and advice to help you apply for college. From choosing suitable classes to preparing for standardized tests to navigating the college application process, I’ve got you covered. Here are the steps to help you get started:</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Untitled" src="/blog/assets/images/blog-1-2-411141cc499438678f31e5aafa71b235.png" width="626" height="352" class="img_ev3q"></p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="college-or-no-college">College or No College?<a href="#college-or-no-college" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to College or No College?" title="Direct link to College or No College?">​</a></h2><p>Before you begin the college application process, you should decide if you are ready for college or want to take a Gap Year. If you are unsure about your readiness for college or if you are still trying to figure out what you want to do, then a Gap Year might be the best option for you. However, if you feel ready for college and are looking for a challenge, then applying to college might be the right choice. Remember, you can always change your major if you are unhappy with your choice. It is common for students to either adjust their initial academic plans or completely alter their career paths. Currently, which academic fields align with your interests or aspirations the most? If you have the answer, you’re good to go. If not, take some time - you’ll never know what beautiful ideas can spontaneously find you. But not to worry, there’s always another option, another solution. If you’re entirely unsure, take a free year and discover yourself. One website that helped me quite a lot in figuring out my major and what I wanted to do is <a href="https://futurescape.asa.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ASA Futurescape.</a> On this website, you get to explore careers and majors based on your personality through a fun game. See for yourself. What might also help is to find a list of all the majors and career options available and go through each one that interests you in the slightest, research, and list it out on a document (Throughout your college application process, be sure to keep track of everything and record all information and research notes either on Google Docs, Notion, Notes App, etc.)</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="research">Research<a href="#research" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Research" title="Direct link to Research">​</a></h2><p>Once you have made the decision to apply to college, the next step is to research your options. This includes finding colleges that are located in areas that you are interested in, have majors that you want to study, are ranked highly, offer scholarships and financial aid, have testing policies that fit your needs, have budget plans that you can afford, and offer housing that you like. Additionally, you should also research the application requirements, such as recommendation letters and essays, and payment options. Are you looking to settle in a nice suburban place just outside Boston, or enjoy the stress of a big urban city? Can you afford to pay your tuition all at once? Would Financial Aid be of help? These are some of the questions you should start asking yourself and potentially find the answer to, hopefully somewhere within the lines of this blog. Make sure to use many college finding engines like College Board, CollegeExpress, Niche, College Navigator, etc. to help you with forming your first potential college list. </p><p>Below, you can find the main elements/factors to focus on while searching for colleges (NOT in order - press on each arrow for the toggled list of descriptions):</p><details class="details_lb9f alert alert--info details_b_Ee" data-collapsed="true"><summary>Location</summary><div><div class="collapsibleContent_i85q"><aside><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.notion.so/icons/graduate_blue.svg" alt="college-hat-image" width="40px" class="img_ev3q"> Location is an important factor while searching for colleges because it can greatly impact your college experience. The location of a college can affect factors such as the climate, culture, and social opportunities available. Additionally, the location can affect access to resources such as internships, research opportunities, and networking events. For some students, it may be important to consider schools located in a certain region or city for personal or family reasons. Ultimately, the location of a college should be considered alongside other factors such as academic programs, financial aid, and campus culture to determine the best fit for your needs and goals.</aside></div></div></details><details class="details_lb9f alert alert--info details_b_Ee" data-collapsed="true"><summary>Financial Aid/Budget/Payments/Cost and Fees</summary><div><div class="collapsibleContent_i85q"><aside><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.notion.so/icons/graduate_blue.svg" alt="college-hat-image" width="40px" class="img_ev3q"> It is essential to research and compare the cost and financial aid opportunities offered by different colleges to ensure that you can afford to attend the college that best suits your needs and goals. Financial aid can help cover the cost of attending college for students who would otherwise struggle to afford it. Additionally, some colleges may offer more generous financial aid packages than others, so it is important to research and compare the options available to you. Ultimately, the cost of college and the availability of financial aid should be considered alongside other factors such as academic programs, campus culture, and location to determine the best fit for your needs and goals.</aside></div></div></details><details class="details_lb9f alert alert--info details_b_Ee" data-collapsed="true"><summary>Housing/Living</summary><div><div class="collapsibleContent_i85q"><aside><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.notion.so/icons/graduate_blue.svg" alt="college-hat-image" width="40px" class="img_ev3q"> The type of housing available and the location of the college can affect factors such as your social opportunities, your commute, and your access to resources such as dining halls and other amenities. It is important to consider your housing preferences and needs when researching colleges to ensure that you can find a living situation that suits you and supports your academic goals.</aside></div></div></details><details class="details_lb9f alert alert--info details_b_Ee" data-collapsed="true"><summary>Major availability/Range of Programs</summary><div><div class="collapsibleContent_i85q"><aside><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.notion.so/icons/graduate_blue.svg" alt="college-hat-image" width="40px" class="img_ev3q"> If you have a clear idea of what you want to study, you&#x27;ll want to look for colleges that have strong programs in that field. However, if you&#x27;re not sure what you want to study, you may want to look for colleges that have a wide range of programs to choose from, so that you can explore your options and find the right fit for your interests and goals. Additionally, having a range of program options can also be helpful if you change your mind about your major later on, as it can provide you with more flexibility in your academic and career choices.</aside></div></div></details><details class="details_lb9f alert alert--info details_b_Ee" data-collapsed="true"><summary>Ranking</summary><div><div class="collapsibleContent_i85q"><aside><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.notion.so/icons/graduate_blue.svg" alt="college-hat-image" width="40px" class="img_ev3q"> Generally, higher-ranked colleges are perceived as more prestigious and may offer more opportunities for networking, research, and internships. However, it is important to remember that rankings are not the only factor to consider when researching colleges, and that a lower-ranked college may still be a good fit for your needs and goals. It is important to also consider factors such as location, financial aid opportunities, and campus culture when researching colleges to determine the best fit for your needs and goals.</aside></div></div></details><details class="details_lb9f alert alert--info details_b_Ee" data-collapsed="true"><summary>Need-based/Merit Scholarships</summary><div><div class="collapsibleContent_i85q"><aside><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.notion.so/icons/graduate_blue.svg" alt="college-hat-image" width="40px" class="img_ev3q"> A need-based scholarship is awarded to students who demonstrate financial need. This means that the scholarship is intended to help cover the cost of attending college for students who would otherwise struggle to afford it. On the other hand, a merit-based scholarship is awarded to students based on their academic or extracurricular achievements, regardless of their financial need. These scholarships are typically awarded to students who have achieved a certain level of excellence in a particular area, such as academics, athletics, or the arts.</aside></div></div></details><details class="details_lb9f alert alert--info details_b_Ee" data-collapsed="true"><summary>Acceptance Rate</summary><div><div class="collapsibleContent_i85q"><aside><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.notion.so/icons/graduate_blue.svg" alt="college-hat-image" width="40px" class="img_ev3q"> Acceptance rate is an important factor to consider when researching colleges because it gives an idea of how competitive the college is and how likely you are to be accepted. However, it is important to remember that acceptance rate is not the only factor to consider when researching colleges, and that a lower-ranked college may still be a good fit for your needs and goals. It is important to also consider factors such as location, financial aid opportunities, and campus culture when researching colleges to determine the best fit for your needs and goals.</aside></div></div></details><details class="details_lb9f alert alert--info details_b_Ee" data-collapsed="true"><summary>Internship Opportunities</summary><div><div class="collapsibleContent_i85q"><aside><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.notion.so/icons/graduate_blue.svg" alt="college-hat-image" width="40px" class="img_ev3q"> Internship opportunities are important while searching for colleges because they can provide valuable real-world experience and help students build their professional networks. Internships can also help students explore potential career paths and gain a better understanding of their field of study. Additionally, having access to internships can make a college more attractive to students who are interested in pursuing careers in certain fields or industries. Ultimately, the availability of internship opportunities should be considered alongside other factors such as academic programs, campus culture, and location to determine the best fit for your needs and goals.</aside></div></div></details><details class="details_lb9f alert alert--info details_b_Ee" data-collapsed="true"><summary>Study Abroad Programs</summary><div><div class="collapsibleContent_i85q"><aside><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.notion.so/icons/graduate_blue.svg" alt="college-hat-image" width="40px" class="img_ev3q"> Studying abroad can broaden a student&#x27;s perspective and help them develop important skills such as adaptability, cultural awareness, and global communication. Additionally, studying abroad can be a unique and exciting way for students to explore their academic interests and gain a deeper understanding of their field of study. Ultimately, the availability of study abroad programs should be considered alongside other factors such as academic programs, financial aid, and campus culture to determine the best fit for your needs and goals.</aside></div></div></details><details class="details_lb9f alert alert--info details_b_Ee" data-collapsed="true"><summary>Campus/Student Life</summary><div><div class="collapsibleContent_i85q"><aside><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.notion.so/icons/graduate_blue.svg" alt="college-hat-image" width="40px" class="img_ev3q"> The campus and student life can affect factors such as the social opportunities available, the extracurricular activities that are offered, and the overall culture of the college. Additionally, the campus and student life can affect access to resources such as dining halls, housing, and other amenities. Ultimately, the campus and student life should be considered alongside other factors such as academic programs, financial aid, and location to determine the best fit for your needs and goals.</aside></div></div></details><details class="details_lb9f alert alert--info details_b_Ee" data-collapsed="true"><summary>Class Size</summary><div><div class="collapsibleContent_i85q"><aside><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.notion.so/icons/graduate_blue.svg" alt="college-hat-image" width="40px" class="img_ev3q"> Smaller class sizes generally allow for more individualized attention from professors and can create a more personalized and engaging learning environment. Larger class sizes can offer more diverse perspectives and may provide more opportunities for group work and collaboration. Ultimately, the ideal class size will depend on your learning style and preferences, as well as the specific academic programs and courses offered by the colleges you are considering.</aside></div></div></details><details class="details_lb9f alert alert--info details_b_Ee" data-collapsed="true"><summary>Safety</summary><div><div class="collapsibleContent_i85q"><aside><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.notion.so/icons/graduate_blue.svg" alt="college-hat-image" width="40px" class="img_ev3q"> The safety of a college can affect factors such as your personal well-being, the security of your belongings, and the overall campus culture. Additionally, the safety of a college can affect access to resources such as internships, research opportunities, and networking events. Ultimately, the safety of a college should be considered alongside other factors such as academic programs, financial aid, and location to determine the best fit for your needs and goals.</aside></div></div></details><details class="details_lb9f alert alert--info details_b_Ee" data-collapsed="true"><summary>Need-blind/aware Admissions</summary><div><div class="collapsibleContent_i85q"><aside><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.notion.so/icons/graduate_blue.svg" alt="college-hat-image" width="40px" class="img_ev3q"> Need-blind admissions means that a college or university does not consider an applicant&#x27;s financial need when making admissions decisions. This means that a student&#x27;s ability to pay for tuition and other costs is not a factor in whether or not they are accepted. On the other hand, need-aware admissions means that a college or university does take a student&#x27;s financial need into consideration when making admissions decisions. This means that if a student requires financial aid to attend the school, their application may be less competitive than that of a student who does not require financial aid. It is important to note that not all institutions have the same policies when it comes to need-blind and need-aware admissions. Some schools may be need-blind for domestic students but need-aware for international students, for example. It is always best to check with individual institutions to understand their specific policies.</aside></div></div></details><details class="details_lb9f alert alert--info details_b_Ee" data-collapsed="true"><summary>Academic Support</summary><div><div class="collapsibleContent_i85q"><aside><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.notion.so/icons/graduate_blue.svg" alt="college-hat-image" width="40px" class="img_ev3q"> Academic support can come in many forms, such as tutoring services, study groups, writing centers, and academic advisors. These resources can help you stay on track with your coursework, improve your study skills, and get the support and guidance you need to succeed academically. Additionally, having access to academic support can be particularly important if you have a learning disability or if you are transitioning from a different educational system, as it can help you navigate the challenges of college-level coursework more effectively. Ultimately, the availability of academic support should be considered alongside other factors such as location, financial aid, and campus culture to determine the best fit for your needs and goals.</aside></div></div></details><details class="details_lb9f alert alert--info details_b_Ee" data-collapsed="true"><summary>Diversity</summary><div><div class="collapsibleContent_i85q"><aside><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.notion.so/icons/graduate_blue.svg" alt="college-hat-image" width="40px" class="img_ev3q"> When you attend a college with a diverse student body, you are exposed to people from different backgrounds and cultures. This exposure can help you develop empathy and respect for others and broaden your understanding of the world. Additionally, a diverse college community can better prepare you for the real world by providing you with experience interacting with people from all walks of life, which is essential in today&#x27;s globalized workforce. Furthermore, a diverse college community can enrich your learning experience. When students from different backgrounds come together, they bring unique perspectives and experiences, leading to more dynamic classroom discussions and a deeper understanding of course material. Attending a college with diversity can also challenge your assumptions and biases, which can be valuable in personal growth and development.</aside></div></div></details><details class="details_lb9f alert alert--info details_b_Ee" data-collapsed="true"><summary>Loan Policy</summary><div><div class="collapsibleContent_i85q"><aside><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.notion.so/icons/graduate_blue.svg" alt="college-hat-image" width="40px" class="img_ev3q"> The loan policy is an important factor to consider when searching for colleges because it can have a significant impact on your financial future. When you take out loans to pay for college, you will be required to repay the borrowed amount with interest. The loan policy of a college can determine the amount of debt you will have to take on, the interest rates you will be charged, and the terms of repayment. A college with a generous loan policy may offer a variety of low-interest loans and grants that can help reduce your financial burden. On the other hand, a college with a restrictive loan policy may only offer high-interest loans or limited financial aid, which can increase your debt and make it more difficult to repay your loans after graduation.</aside></div></div></details><details class="details_lb9f alert alert--info details_b_Ee" data-collapsed="true"><summary>Institution Type</summary><div><div class="collapsibleContent_i85q"><aside><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.notion.so/icons/graduate_blue.svg" alt="college-hat-image" width="40px" class="img_ev3q"> The type of institution is important when searching for colleges because it can have a significant impact on the academic and social experience of a student. Different types of institutions have different academic focuses, social environments, sizes, and costs. For example, a liberal arts college will generally offer a broad-based education with an emphasis on critical thinking and intellectual exploration, while a technical school may have a more specialized curriculum that focuses on preparing students for specific careers. The size of the institution can affect everything from class size to the range of extracurricular activities available. Larger institutions may offer a wider variety of programs and resources, but smaller institutions may offer a more personalized education and a closer-knit community. The social environment can also vary significantly between institutions. A rural college may have a more tight-knit community with limited opportunities for nightlife, while an urban institution may offer more social opportunities but with a more bustling and potentially overwhelming atmosphere. Finally, the type of institution can also affect the cost of education. Public institutions tend to be less expensive than private institutions, and two-year institutions generally have lower tuition costs than four-year institutions. It&#x27;s important to consider the affordability of the institution type and how it aligns with your financial situation.</aside></div></div></details><details class="details_lb9f alert alert--info details_b_Ee" data-collapsed="true"><summary>Sports Division/Athletic Life</summary><div><div class="collapsibleContent_i85q"><aside><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.notion.so/icons/graduate_blue.svg" alt="college-hat-image" width="40px" class="img_ev3q"> When searching for colleges, the sports division/athletic life can be an important factor to consider for several reasons. For one, many colleges offer athletic scholarships to talented athletes, which can help offset the cost of tuition and other expenses. Additionally, colleges with strong athletic programs often have state-of-the-art athletic facilities, which can help you improve your athletic abilities and provide a better overall college experience. Being part of an athletic team can also give you a sense of belonging and camaraderie with your teammates, which can help you adjust to college life and make new friends more easily. Participating in athletics can also help you maintain a healthy and active lifestyle, and many colleges offer resources for student-athletes to help you stay healthy and perform at your best. Finally, if you are interested in pursuing a career in sports, a college with a strong athletic program can provide opportunities to gain experience and network with professionals in the field. While the sports division/athletic life is an important factor to consider, it&#x27;s important to balance this with other important factors, such as academics, campus culture, and location, to ensure you find the best college fit for your needs and goals.</aside></div></div></details><p>These steps can be completed in any order you choose, as stated above, depending on what is most important to you. You can select your main factors to be the primary focus and use a strategic approach as you go through the rest. The application process is an intricate process, which can easily be a mishap if taken with the wrong approach. It requires attention to detail, patience, and perseverance. Keeping a positive attitude throughout is your best bet, even the most qualified applicants can be turned down. A significant component of the admission process is luck, yet hard work can bring massive returns for a student with grand ambitions. Before you go through the process of applying, it&#x27;s important to be aware of how it works, no matter which college you&#x27;re looking to attend. Personally, I had to face this challenge on my own. I started off from scratch but managed to finish, nevertheless. If you take the big job and break it down into manageable pieces, anything is achievable, even if it feels impossible. The list above includes most but not all factors that can be important for a student while searching for colleges. I have included the most common yet the most important ones students usually go for. For you, the campus&#x27;s proximity to your home may be the most crucial factor, while for another student, the renown of the school&#x27;s reputation could be what tips the balance. It is all dependable on one’s interests. </p><p>Some colleges have their particular application process, which you can usually find on the college’s website, but most U.S. colleges tend to use Common App for this process. On the <a href="https://apply.commonapp.org/login" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Common App</a> first year-ers and transfer students can apply by searching up and creating their specialized college list. For further information, you can find it in Common App’s FAQ section. Another application or platform often used by students and colleges is Coalition, which has similar features, yet not quite the same requirements. Of course, this is up to you whether Common App or Coalition seems like a better option. It is YOUR choice at the end of the day. </p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="provision">Provision<a href="#provision" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Provision" title="Direct link to Provision">​</a></h2><p>When it comes to preparing for college and future employment opportunities, there are several things that high school students should keep in mind. One of the most important is the value of extracurricular activities, AP classes, and community service hours. First and foremost, it&#x27;s important to START EARLY. I cannot stress this enough!!! Starting early will give you heads-up for the complex procedure you’re going to put yourself through with every step of the application. Students should begin thinking about these things as soon as possible so they have plenty of time to develop their skills and make an impact in their community. If you start early, your future self is going to thank you! However, it&#x27;s also important to choose wisely. Students should participate in activities they are genuinely interested in, rather than just trying to impress colleges or build up their resumes. Consistency is key when it comes to extracurricular activities. Students should commit to their activities for the long term, rather than dropping out after a semester or two. Additionally, seeking leadership roles within these activities can be a great way to develop valuable skills and demonstrate dedication and commitment. AP classes are another important consideration. These classes can prepare students for college-level coursework and demonstrate to colleges that they are capable of handling challenging academic material. However, it&#x27;s important not to overload oneself with too many activities or classes, as this can lead to burnout and stress. Finally, it&#x27;s important to be true to oneself. Students should participate in activities and take classes that align with their passions and interests, rather than just trying to impress others. By being authentic and genuine, students can be happier and more compelling candidates for college or future employment opportunities. Colleges care about extracurricular activities, AP classes, and community service because they provide insights into a student&#x27;s character, interests, and potential for success in college. Extracurricular activities demonstrate that students are well-rounded and have developed skills outside of the classroom. These activities can show colleges that students are passionate, dedicated, and have leadership skills. It can also show that they can manage their time effectively by balancing academics and other responsibilities. AP classes demonstrate that students are willing to challenge themselves academically and are capable of handling college-level coursework. AP classes are often more rigorous than regular high school courses, and achieving high scores on AP exams can indicate that students are prepared for the academic demands of college. Community service shows that students are committed to giving back to their community, have a sense of social responsibility, and are willing to contribute to society. Colleges value students who are engaged in their communities and are passionate about making a positive impact. Overall, the more active you seem to colleges, the more they’re going to want to invest in you!</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="organizingplanning">Organizing/Planning<a href="#organizingplanning" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Organizing/Planning" title="Direct link to Organizing/Planning">​</a></h2><p>When it comes to applying for college, staying organized is key. With so many different deadlines, requirements, and options to consider, it can be overwhelming to keep track of everything. That&#x27;s why creating a system for the organization is essential for success.
One of the first things you can do is create a list of potential colleges. This can include reach, match, and safety schools. You can use college-finding engines such as the College Board or other online resources to help you generate this list. Once you have your list, make sure to add each college to your send list on your email so that you can receive their info emails. It&#x27;s also a good idea to write down the admissions emails for each college in case you need to reach out to them directly.
To stay on top of deadlines, keep track of them as soon as you find out about them. Write them down in a planner or calendar and make note of whether they are regular or early decision deadlines. It&#x27;s also important to keep track of your financial aid deadlines, as missing these could impact your ability to receive aid.
As you consider your priorities for college, rank them or put them in order so that you can focus on the most important ones first. Is financial coverage a top priority? Or maybe it&#x27;s selecting a major or finding suitable housing options. Knowing what matters most to you can help you make informed decisions as you navigate the college application process.
Overall, staying organized throughout the college application process can make a big difference in your success. By creating a system for organization, you can stay on top of deadlines, keep track of important information, and prioritize your goals. This can help you navigate the college application process with confidence and ease. At the end of this blog, in the mentions section, I have included a spreadsheet all ready to be used by you.
{Click here for the spreadsheet}</p><p>In addition to filling out the applications themselves, there are several documents that are required for the process. These documents need to be secured and organized in order to ensure that they are readily available when needed. </p><p><em>Academic Documents</em></p><p>Academic documents, including high school transcripts, mid-year reports, and diplomas (if graduated) are essential to the college application process. These documents prove your academic achievements and are often a key factor in the admissions decision. It is important to keep these documents in a secure location, such as a locked file cabinet, and to make copies for backup purposes. </p><p><em>Financial Documents</em></p><p>Financial documents, such as tax returns, W-2 forms, and bank statements, are also necessary for the college application process, especially if you are applying for financial aid. These documents can provide a picture of your financial situation and can help the college determine your eligibility for aid. It is important to keep these documents in a secure location as well and to make sure that they are up-to-date and accurate. </p><p><em>Standardized Tests</em></p><p>Standardized tests such as the SAT, ACT, Toefl, Duolingo, GED, etc. are also an essential part of the college application process. These tests can be challenging, and it is important to prepare well in advance. It is also important to register for the tests early and to make sure that you have all of the necessary information and materials, such as your ID and admission ticket. </p><p><em>Interviews</em> </p><p>Many colleges and universities offer interviews as part of the application process, and it is important to take advantage of these opportunities, even if they are optional. Interviews can provide valuable insights into the college or university and can help you stand out as a candidate. It is also important to prepare for the interview by researching the college or university, and by practicing your interview skills. </p><p><em>Recommendation Letters</em></p><p>Recommendation letters are another important part of the college application process. These letters can provide insight into your character, achievements, and potential, and can help the college better understand who you are as a person. It is important to request these letters early and to make sure that you choose recommenders who know you well and who can write strong letters on your behalf. </p><p><em>Application Fee Waivers</em></p><p>Finally, it is important to request application fee waivers if needed. Applying to college can be expensive, and many colleges and universities offer fee waivers to students who demonstrate financial need. These waivers can help to reduce the cost of applying and can make it easier for you to afford the application fees.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="financial-aid-application">Financial Aid Application<a href="#financial-aid-application" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Financial Aid Application" title="Direct link to Financial Aid Application">​</a></h2><p>Grab your dad or mom, and together start thinking about how to apply for financial aid - if that’s your choice. Filling out the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) or the College Scholarship Service (CSS) Profile is the first step in the financial aid process. But, it&#x27;s not just about filling out the forms, it&#x27;s about doing it on time. The FAFSA and CSS Profile are the two most common forms used to determine your eligibility for financial aid. The FAFSA is used to determine your eligibility for federal financial aid, while the CSS Profile is used by many colleges and universities to determine eligibility for institutional aid. Each college has its own deadline for submitting financial aid forms, so it&#x27;s essential to check the deadline for each college you plan to apply. It&#x27;s best to start early and make sure you have plenty of time to complete the application process. Remember that some colleges have early application deadlines for financial aid, so it&#x27;s crucial to know when these deadlines are. Creating a list of all the colleges you plan to apply to and researching their financial aid requirements is an excellent way to stay organized. Take the time to research each college&#x27;s financial aid website to get a clear understanding of what they require. Some colleges may require additional forms or documentation, such as tax returns or bank statements. Be sure to gather all the required documents before the deadline. If you&#x27;re applying for financial aid through the CSS Profile, you may also need to submit the Institutional Documentation Service (IDOC) form. The IDOC form is used to collect additional financial information that colleges may require. The CSS Profile will guide you through the necessary steps, including how to submit the IDOC form.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="filling-out-the-common-app-application---the-important-step">Filling out the Common App Application - The Important Step<a href="#filling-out-the-common-app-application---the-important-step" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Filling out the Common App Application - The Important Step" title="Direct link to Filling out the Common App Application - The Important Step">​</a></h2><p>First things first:</p><p><em>Create an account</em>: Start by creating an account on the Common App website.
